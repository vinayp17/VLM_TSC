In many cases, medical or machine learning classifications for ECG signals are based on specific patterns that indicate different physiological states or abnormalities (e.g., normal rhythm, atrial fibrillation, ischemia, etc.). Class 2 often corresponds to a specific condition that manifests through distinct characteristics in the ECG waveform.\n\n2. **Signal Characteristics**: The time series data shows significant fluctuation in values that suggests varying heart activities typical of certain heart conditions. Initially, the signal starts with relatively\nClass: "

Each class corresponds to distinctive patterns in the ECG waveforms.\n\n2. **Examining the Provided Timeseries Data**: The timeseries data reveals a pattern where the values fluctuate both positive and negative, displaying peaks and troughs that may suggest the presence of electrical activity\nClass: "
